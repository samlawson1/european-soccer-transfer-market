I'm choosing to analyze the European Soccer Transfer Market, where soccer players are bought and sold from one team to another with the goal of improving results on the field. I've looked at the transfer activity of Europe’s Top 5 leagues (English Premier League, French Ligue 1, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, and Spanish La Liga) and have compared the transfer data to a team’s results on the field, ie: wins, losses, and draws. The data range spans from the 2009-2010 season to the 2018-2019 season.
## Why do this?
- I’m a soccer fan and the team I support, Liverpool, has recently become a trailblazer in the sport by using data analysis to find players in the transfer market. I thought I'd give it a go too!
- You can tell a lot of interesting stories with this data! I'll be able to show how little known players helped floundering teams become champions, which teams are great at identifying up and coming talent, and which teams use the transfer market most effectively.
- It's a great way to conduct a financial analysis. Teams are spending hundreds of millions of dollars every season to bring new players in. Here we'll be able to see which teams are spending their money wisely and which teams are wasting it.
## Main Data Question:
- What players had the biggest impact on their new team’s results after being transferred?
## Secondary Questions:
- Which teams use the transfer market most effectively?
- What positions do teams spend the most money on?
- Does spending more money mean winning more?
